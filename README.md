Face Detection Project Using OpenCV and VGG16 Model
Introduction
-Face detection is a critical technology with applications ranging from security systems to human-computer interaction and social media apps. This project leverages OpenCV, a powerful library for computer vision tasks, and VGG16, a pre-trained convolutional neural network, to build an efficient and accurate face detection system.

Objectives
-Detect faces in images and video streams.
-Improve detection accuracy by leveraging deep learning techniques.
-Implement a system that can run in real-time, making it suitable for dynamic environments like surveillance systems.
Tools and Libraries
-OpenCV: An open-source computer vision library that provides tools for image processing, video capture, and analysis.
-VGG16: A pre-trained deep learning model known for its excellent performance in image classification tasks, which can be adapted for face detection
